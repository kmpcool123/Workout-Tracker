#Workout Tracker<br><br>
##Our Mission<br>
We are looking to create an application that can help you to track your workouts. This application will allow you to enter the amounts of reps you are currently doing for a specific exercise and follow your progress as you continue to work to your goals. This is targeted to anyone that wants to start or improve their workout routines.
