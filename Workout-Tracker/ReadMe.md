#Workout Tracker
##Our Mission
We are looking to create an application that can help you to track your workouts. This application will allow you to enter the amounts of reps you are currently doing for a specific exercise and follow your progress as you continue to work to your goals. This is targeted to anyone that wants to start or improve their workout routines.
